## Subject: Advanced RAG: Re-ranking Implementation

### Summary

This log entry details the implementation of an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique: re-ranking. A cross-encoder model has been integrated into the retrieval pipeline to improve the relevance of document chunks passed to the generation module, thereby enhancing answer quality.

### Key Deliverables

1.  **`src/retrieval/retriever.py` Modified:**
    *   Imported `CrossEncoder` from `sentence_transformers`.
    *   Loaded a pre-trained cross-encoder model (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) at the module level for efficiency.
    *   The `query_collection` function was updated to:
        *   Retrieve an initial larger set of candidate chunks from ChromaDB (`initial_retrieval_k`).
        *   Perform re-ranking on these candidates using the `CrossEncoder` model, scoring each chunk's relevance to the query.
        *   Select the top `rerank_k` chunks based on these scores.
        *   The `top_k` parameter now represents the initial retrieval count, and a new `rerank_k` parameter specifies the final number of chunks after re-ranking.

2.  **`ingestion_service.py` Modified:**
    *   The `QueryRequest` BaseModel was updated to include `rerank_k` as a parameter, with a default value of 3.
    *   The `/query` endpoint was modified to pass both `top_k` (as initial retrieval count) and `rerank_k` to the `query_collection` function.

3.  **`tests/test_retrieval_pipeline.py` Modified:**
    *   The `setup_and_teardown_retrieval_test` fixture was enhanced to ingest multiple documents, creating a more diverse dataset suitable for testing re-ranking.
    *   A new test case, `test_retrieval_with_reranking`, was added to specifically verify the re-ranking logic. This test asserts that the re-ranked results correctly prioritize more relevant documents.
    *   Existing tests (`test_retrieval_success`, `test_retrieval_no_results`) were updated to use the new `rerank_k` parameter.

### Verification

*   All 8 tests, including the newly added `test_retrieval_with_reranking`, passed successfully.
*   This confirms that the re-ranking logic is correctly integrated into the retrieval pipeline and that the system maintains its stability and functionality.

### Status

The implementation of re-ranking as an advanced RAG technique is complete and verified. The system now leverages a cross-encoder model to improve the relevance of retrieved context, which is expected to lead to higher quality generated answers.
