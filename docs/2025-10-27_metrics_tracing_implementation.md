## Subject: Phase 8: Monitoring & Observability (Metrics & Tracing) Implementation

### Summary

This log entry details the implementation of Phase 8, focusing on enhancing the system's monitoring and observability through the integration of Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry distributed tracing. This provides deeper insights into the system's performance, latency, and component interactions.

### Key Deliverables

1.  **`requirements.txt` Updated:**
    *   Added `prometheus_client`, `opentelemetry-sdk`, `opentelemetry-api`, `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc`, `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi`, and `opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx` to the project dependencies.

2.  **`src/utils/metrics.py` Created:**
    *   Defined Prometheus `Counter`, `Histogram`, and `Gauge` metrics for tracking HTTP requests, request durations, in-progress requests, and durations of key RAG pipeline components (ingestion, retrieval, re-ranking, generation, embedding, ChromaDB queries, Ollama API calls).

3.  **`src/utils/tracing.py` Created:**
    *   Configured OpenTelemetry `TracerProvider` with an `OTLPSpanExporter` to send traces to a collector (e.g., Jaeger).
    *   Instrumented FastAPI using `FastAPIInstrumentor` and `httpx` using `HTTPXClientInstrumentor`.
    *   Provided a `tracer` instance for manual instrumentation.

4.  **Core Modules Instrumented:**
    *   **`ingestion_service.py`:**
        *   Integrated `setup_tracing(app)`.
        *   Added a `/metrics` endpoint to expose Prometheus metrics.
        *   Instrumented `/ingest` and `/query` endpoints with `REQUEST_COUNT`, `REQUEST_LATENCY_SECONDS`, and `IN_PROGRESS_REQUESTS` metrics.
    *   **`src/ingestion/processor.py`:**
        *   Instrumented `ingest_document` with a span and `INGESTION_DURATION_SECONDS` metric.
        *   Instrumented `_embed_batch` with a span and `EMBEDDING_DURATION_SECONDS` metric.
        *   Instrumented `_upsert_to_chroma` with a span and `CHROMA_QUERY_DURATION_SECONDS` metric.
    *   **`src/retrieval/retriever.py`:**
        *   Instrumented `query_collection` with a span and `RETRIEVAL_DURATION_SECONDS` metric.
        *   Instrumented ChromaDB query within `query_collection` with a span and `CHROMA_QUERY_DURATION_SECONDS` metric.
        *   Instrumented re-ranking logic within `query_collection` with a span and `RERANKING_DURATION_SECONDS` metric.
    *   **`src/generation/generator.py`:**
        *   Instrumented `generate_answer` with a span and `GENERATION_DURATION_SECONDS` metric.
        *   Instrumented Ollama API call within `generate_answer` with a span and `OLLAMA_API_CALL_DURATION_SECONDS` metric.

5.  **`README.md` Updated:**
    *   Added a new section "Phase 7: Monitoring & Observability (Metrics & Tracing)" with instructions on how to run the FastAPI backend with tracing enabled, how to view metrics, and how to view traces using a Jaeger collector.

### Verification

*   All 8 tests passed successfully after integrating the metrics and tracing instrumentation and reinstalling dependencies.
*   This confirms that the new observability setup did not introduce any regressions and the application's core functionality remains stable.
*   The system is now ready to expose metrics at `/metrics` and send traces to an OTLP collector.

### Status

Phase 8, the implementation of Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry tracing for Monitoring & Observability, is complete and verified. The system now provides comprehensive insights into its performance and operational flow.
