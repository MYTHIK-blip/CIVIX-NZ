# Project Log: Git LFS Remediation and Release Branch Creation

**Date:** 2025-10-29

## 1. Git LFS Remediation

### Problem:
A `git push` failed due to `models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/model.safetensors` exceeding GitHub's 50MB file size limit. The `git-lfs` client was not installed.

### Resolution Steps:
1.  **Installed Git LFS:** The user installed `git-lfs` on the local system.
2.  **Initialized Git LFS:** Ran `git lfs install` in the project root.
3.  **Tracked Large Files:** Configured Git LFS to track `*.safetensors` files using `git lfs track "*.safetensors"`. This created/updated the `.gitattributes` file.
4.  **Re-created Commits:** The two most recent commits, which were undone previously, were re-created:
    *   `fix(system): Resolve embedding cache and update model` (included `.gitattributes`, `models/`, and relevant source/test files).
    *   `üìù docs: Update documentation and scripts` (included various documentation updates and `scripts/benchmark.py`).
5.  **Successful Push:** The `main` branch was successfully pushed to `origin/main` after these steps.

## 2. Release Branch Creation

### Objective:
To establish a "frozen" branch for rollback, tags, and asset management, aligning with the project's versioning cadence.

### Steps Taken:
1.  **Created New Branch:** A new branch `release-2025-10-29` was created from the `main` branch.
2.  **Created Lightweight Tag:** A lightweight tag `v0.1.0-release-2025-10-29` was applied to the `release-2025-10-29` branch.
3.  **Pushed Branch and Tag:** Both the `release-2025-10-29` branch and the `v0.1.0-release-2025-10-29` tag were pushed to the remote repository (`origin`).

### Outcome:
A stable, tagged release branch is now available for version tracking and potential rollbacks, enhancing the project's integrity and adherence to the defined methodology.
