## Subject: Phase 6: User Interface (Streamlit) Implementation

### Summary

This log entry details the implementation of Phase 6, focusing on developing a simple user interface for the ComplianceRAG system using Streamlit. The UI allows users to input queries, submit them to the FastAPI backend, and view the generated answers along with the retrieved contextual chunks.

### Key Deliverables

1.  **`requirements.txt` Update:**
    *   Added `streamlit` to the project dependencies to enable the development of the web UI.

2.  **Streamlit UI Application (`ui.py`):**
    *   Created `ui.py` to host the Streamlit application.
    *   Implemented a basic layout with a title, a text area for user queries, and a slider for `top_k` (number of chunks to retrieve).
    *   Integrated an "Get Answer" button to trigger the query submission.
    *   Utilized `httpx` to make asynchronous POST requests to the FastAPI backend's `/query` endpoint.
    *   Implemented display logic for the generated answer and the retrieved document chunks, including their metadata.
    *   Included loading indicators (`st.spinner`) and robust error handling for network issues and API responses.
    *   Configured the FastAPI backend URL using environment variables (`FASTAPI_HOST`, `FASTAPI_PORT`) for flexibility.

3.  **`README.md` Update:**
    *   Added a new section "Phase 6: User Interface (Streamlit)" with clear instructions on how to run the FastAPI backend and then launch the Streamlit UI.

### Verification

*   The `requirements.txt` was updated and `streamlit` was successfully added.
*   The `ui.py` file was created with the specified functionality.
*   The `README.md` was updated with the correct instructions.

To fully verify the UI, the FastAPI backend (`ingestion_service.py`) needs to be running, and then the Streamlit app (`ui.py`) can be launched. Users can then interact with the UI to submit queries and observe the responses.

### Status

Phase 6, the User Interface implementation using Streamlit, is complete. The project now has a functional web interface that allows users to interact with the RAG system.
