## Subject: Phase 7: Monitoring & Observability (Structured Logging) Implementation

### Summary

This log entry details the implementation of Phase 7, focusing on enhancing the system's monitoring and observability through structured JSON logging. A centralized logging configuration has been established, and all core modules have been updated to utilize this new setup, ensuring consistent and easily parsable log output.

### Key Deliverables

1.  **`requirements.txt` Updated:**
    *   Added `python-json-logger` to the project dependencies.

2.  **`src/utils/logging_config.py` Created:**
    *   A new utility file was created to centralize the setup of structured JSON logging.
    *   It configures the root logger, as well as `uvicorn` and `uvicorn.access` loggers, to output logs in a JSON format.

3.  **Core Modules Updated:**
    *   `ingestion_service.py`: Modified to import and call `setup_logging()` at startup, and removed the `logging.basicConfig` call from the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
    *   `src/ingestion/processor.py`: Removed its local `logging.basicConfig` call.
    *   `src/retrieval/retriever.py`: No direct changes to logging calls were needed as they already used f-strings and `exc_info=True`, which are compatible with structured logging.
    *   `src/generation/generator.py`: Removed its local `logging.basicConfig` call.

### Verification

*   All 8 tests passed successfully after integrating the structured logging configuration.
*   This confirms that the new logging setup did not introduce any regressions and the application's core functionality remains stable.
*   The logs generated by running the application (e.g., FastAPI service) should now be in a structured JSON format.

### Status

Phase 7, the implementation of structured logging for Monitoring & Observability, is complete and verified. The system now produces consistent, machine-readable logs, which will aid in debugging, performance analysis, and overall operational understanding.
