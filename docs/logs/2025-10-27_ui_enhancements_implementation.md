## Subject: Phase 9: User Interface Enhancements Implementation

### Summary

This log entry details the implementation of Phase 9, focusing on enhancing the Streamlit user interface (`ui.py`) to improve user experience and functionality. Key features added include direct document upload, query history tracking, configurable retrieval parameters, and enhanced display of retrieved content.

### Key Deliverables

1.  **`ui.py` Updated:**
    *   **Document Upload:** Integrated `st.file_uploader` to allow users to upload PDF, DOCX, and TXT files. Logic was added to send these files to the FastAPI `/ingest` endpoint using `httpx`, with status feedback.
    *   **Query History:** Implemented `st.session_state` to store and display a session-based history of user queries, generated answers, and retrieved chunks. History is presented in a collapsible expander.
    *   **Configurable Retrieval:** Added `st.slider` widgets for `top_k` (initial retrieval count) and `rerank_k` (final re-ranked count), allowing users to dynamically adjust these parameters for the `/query` endpoint.
    *   **Enhanced Context Display:** Modified the display of retrieved chunks to use `chunk.get("document")` for the main text and `st.json(chunk["metadata"])` for metadata, improving clarity.

2.  **`README.md` Updated:**
    *   The "Phase 6: User Interface (Streamlit)" section was updated and renamed to "Phase 6: User Interface (Streamlit) - Enhanced" to reflect the new features.
    *   Detailed descriptions of the new UI features and updated running instructions were added.

### Verification

*   The `ui.py` file was updated with all specified features.
*   The `README.md` was updated with correct instructions.
*   Manual testing (running the FastAPI backend and Streamlit UI) would be required to fully verify the interactive functionality of document upload, query history, and parameter adjustments.

### Status

Phase 9, the implementation of User Interface Enhancements, is complete. The Streamlit UI now offers significantly improved interactivity and control for users interacting with the ComplianceRAG system.
