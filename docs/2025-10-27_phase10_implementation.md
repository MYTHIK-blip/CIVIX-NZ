## Subject: Phase 10: System Evaluation - Benchmarking Script Implementation

### Summary

This log entry details the implementation of the benchmarking script as part of Phase 10. The script provides a quantitative and repeatable method for evaluating the end-to-end performance of the ComplianceRAG system.

### Key Changes

1.  **Benchmark Script (`scripts/benchmark.py`):**
    *   A new script was created at `scripts/benchmark.py` to provide a standardized way to evaluate the end-to-end performance and quality of the RAG pipeline.
    *   The script automates the process of:
        *   Ingesting a source document (`data/gdpr_document.txt`).
        *   Querying the system with a predefined set of questions from an evaluation dataset (`data/evaluation_dataset.json`).
        *   Measuring key metrics: latency, answer relevance (answer match), and retrieval success.
    *   This provides a repeatable method for assessing the impact of changes on the system's performance.

2.  **`ingestion_service.py` Enhancement:**
    *   Added `print` statements to the `ingest_file` endpoint to log the incoming request URL and headers.
    *   This was a minor addition to aid in real-time debugging during development and benchmarking.

3. **Documentation Updates:**
    * The `README.md` file was updated with a new "Benchmarking" section explaining how to use the script.
    * The `docs/2025-10-27_progress_log.md` was updated to reflect these changes.

### Status

The benchmark script is now available for use. The `mistral` model error identified during the benchmark run is a runtime environment issue to be addressed separately. This completes the initial implementation step of the Phase 10 plan.
