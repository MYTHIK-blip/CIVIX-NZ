# Project Log: Git LFS Remediation Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-28

## 1. Goal

Resolve the `git push` failure caused by a large file (`model.safetensors`) and successfully push the recent commits to the `origin/main` branch.

## 2. Problem Encountered

While attempting to push commits, GitHub rejected the push with a warning that the file `models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/model.safetensors` (87MB) exceeds the recommended maximum file size of 50MB.

The proposed solution was to use Git Large File Storage (LFS). However, the command `git lfs install` failed, indicating that the `git-lfs` client is not installed on the local system.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Commits Undone:** The two most recent commits (`fix(system): Resolve embedding cache...` and `docs: Update documentation...`) have been undone using `git reset HEAD~2`.
*   **Working Directory:** All changes from the undone commits, including the large model file and documentation updates, are currently present but unstaged in the working directory.
*   **Blocker:** The `git-lfs` client is not installed, preventing us from proceeding with the fix.

## 4. Action Plan for Resumption

When we resume, the following steps need to be taken in order:

1.  **[USER ACTION] Install Git LFS:** You will need to install the `git-lfs` client on your machine.
    *   **For Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install git-lfs`
    *   **For Fedora/CentOS:** `sudo dnf install git-lfs`
    *   **Official instructions:** [https://git-lfs.com](https://git-lfs.com)

2.  **[USER ACTION] Initialize Git LFS:** After installation, run the following command in the project root to initialize LFS for your user account:
    ```bash
    git lfs install
    ```

3.  **[AGENT ACTION] Resume Remediation:** Once you confirm that `git lfs install` runs successfully, I will proceed with the following automated steps:
    a.  Track the large file type with LFS: `git lfs track "*.safetensors"`.
    b.  Stage the new `.gitattributes` file.
    c.  Re-create the two commits with their original messages and files.
    d.  Execute the `git push origin main` command, which should now succeed.
