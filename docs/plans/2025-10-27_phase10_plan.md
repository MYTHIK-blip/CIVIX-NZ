## Subject: Phase 10: System Evaluation and Performance Optimization - Planning

### Summary

This document outlines the plan for Phase 10, focusing on a comprehensive evaluation of the ComplianceRAG system's performance and subsequent optimization efforts. Building upon the established metrics and tracing infrastructure, this phase aims to quantitatively assess the system's effectiveness, identify bottlenecks, and implement targeted improvements to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

### Goal

To rigorously evaluate the ComplianceRAG system's performance, identify areas for improvement, and implement optimizations to enhance its efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

### Key Areas

1.  **Establishing Quantitative Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   Define specific, measurable metrics for RAG system performance.
    *   Metrics will include:
        *   **Answer Relevance:** How well the generated answer addresses the user's query.
        *   **Factual Accuracy:** The correctness of information in the generated answer, verifiable against source documents.
        *   **Context Utilization:** The degree to which the generated answer effectively uses the retrieved context.
        *   **Latency:** End-to-end response time for queries.
        *   **Throughput:** Number of queries processed per unit of time.
        *   **Recall/Precision of Retrieval:** How effectively relevant documents are retrieved and irrelevant ones are filtered.

2.  **Benchmarking:**
    *   Develop or acquire diverse datasets representative of compliance documents and user queries.
    *   Establish a baseline performance by running the current system against these datasets and recording all defined metrics.
    *   Compare performance against any available industry benchmarks or internal targets.

3.  **Performance Bottleneck Identification:**
    *   Utilize the existing Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry traces to analyze system behavior during benchmarking.
    *   Pinpoint specific components or operations contributing most significantly to latency or resource consumption (e.g., embedding generation, ChromaDB queries, re-ranking, Ollama inference).
    *   Analyze logs for recurring errors or warnings that might indicate performance issues.

4.  **Targeted Optimizations:**
    *   Based on bottleneck identification, implement specific optimizations. Potential areas include:
        *   **Model Optimization:** Explore quantization or smaller, more efficient models for embeddings or generation if accuracy can be maintained.
        *   **ChromaDB Optimization:** Review indexing strategies, batching for upserts/queries, or explore alternative vector store configurations.
        *   **Re-ranking Efficiency:** Optimize `CrossEncoder` usage or explore alternative re-ranking models.
        *   **Prompt Engineering:** Refine prompts for the generation model to improve answer quality and reduce token usage.
        *   **Caching Strategies:** Enhance existing caching or introduce new caching layers where beneficial.
        *   **Resource Management:** Fine-tune resource allocation for FastAPI, Ollama, etc.

5.  **Scalability Testing:**
    *   Design and execute load tests to simulate increased user traffic and data volume.
    *   Assess how the system performs under stress, identifying breaking points and resource limits.
    *   Evaluate the system's ability to scale horizontally or vertically.

### Impacted Modules

*   All core components (`ingestion_service.py`, `src/ingestion/processor.py`, `src/retrieval/retriever.py`, `src/generation/generator.py`, `ui.py`) will be subject to evaluation and potential optimization.
*   New scripts or modules may be created for benchmarking and evaluation.

### Implementation Steps

1.  **Define Evaluation Framework:** Document the chosen metrics, datasets, and evaluation methodology.
2.  **Implement Benchmarking Scripts:** Create automated scripts to run queries and ingest documents against the system, collecting performance data.
3.  **Analyze Data:** Use visualization tools (e.g., Grafana with Prometheus, Jaeger UI) to analyze collected metrics and traces.
4.  **Propose & Implement Optimizations:** Based on analysis, propose specific code changes or configuration adjustments and implement them.
5.  **Re-evaluate:** Rerun benchmarks after each significant optimization to measure impact.
6.  **Document Findings:** Log all evaluation results, optimizations made, and their impact in a new progress log.

### Deliverables

*   `docs/2025-10-27_phase10_plan.md` (this document)
*   New evaluation scripts/tools (if necessary).
*   Updated core modules with optimizations.
*   A new progress log detailing evaluation results and optimizations.

### Status

This document serves as the planning phase for Phase 10. Implementation will commence upon approval.
